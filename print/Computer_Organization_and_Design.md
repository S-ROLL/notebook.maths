### Measuring performace

CPU time

User CPU time
System CPU time

Clock cycle (tick/clock tick/clock period/clock/cycle)

clock period

clock rate

### CPU performance & Its factor

$\text{CPU execution time} = \text{CPU clock cycles for a program} \: \times \: \text{Clock cycle time}$

$\text{CPU execution time} = \frac{\text{CPU clock cycles for a program}}{\text{Clock rate}}$

### Instruction performance

Clock cycles per instruction (CPI)

$\text{CPU clock cycles} = \text{Instructions for a program} \: \times \: \text{Average clock cycles per intruction}$

### The classic CPU performance equation

Instruction count

$\text{CPU time} = \text{Instruction count} \: \times \: \text{CPI} \: \times \: \text{Clock cycle time}$
